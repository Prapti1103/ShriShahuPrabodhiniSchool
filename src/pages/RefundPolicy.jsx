            <p>Registration fees, once paid and a roll number generated, are generally
              non-refundable, since a seat and exam material are reserved for the student
              immediately upon successful payment.</p>

            <h2 className="font-display font-bold text-navy text-lg mb-2">Eligible Refund Cases</h2>
            <p>A refund may be considered only in the following situations: (1) the amount was
              debited from your account but registration failed on our portal, (2) duplicate
              payment was made for the same student, or (3) the exam is cancelled or
              rescheduled by Shri Shahu Prabodhini and the student opts out.</p>
